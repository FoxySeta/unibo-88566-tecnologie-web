              <h2>Get out of the city and on a nice beach!</h2>
              Some like their holidays active, others like things slow. There
              is no shame in going on holiday, kicking back and doing
              absolutely nothing, yet so often in reality it doesn't quite
              work out like that. Arrive in a new destination, and most of us
              will instantly want to head out and explore every nook and
              cranny. We just can't help ourselves. We have come up with a few
              locations that will help you a hand in resolving this conondrum.
              These destinations feature some of the most spectacular scenery
              seen anywhere in the world, but there is not much to do other
              than gawk at it in awe, and kick back...

              <h3>Off the beaten track</h3>
              Maybe we are spoiled. We are running this website out of
              tropical Singapore, which means year-round warm temperatures at
              home anyway, but also countless fantastic South-east Asian
              travel destinations just a weekend trip away. Whether we want to
              jet off to Bali or Phuket, to Bangkok or Hong Kong, it is often
              a matter of conveniently flying off on a budget airline after
              work on a Friday and returning late on a Sunday. The only
              downside to this is that we are not the only one doing this! You
              can fly to Krabi or Nha Trang, but then in many places you will
              still spend your weekend packed like sardines on a beach, next
              to your neighbours back home. Long story short, sometimes you
              want to head off to a place with palm trees and white sand
              beaches but at the same time get away from the crowds as well.
              If that's what you are after, we have some suggestions for you
              (that are not just located in Asia, of course). For even more
              inspiration just use our Destination Search.

                <h3>Fernando de Noronha, Brazil</h3>
                The first destination is an island well off the coast of Brazil in South America called Fernando de
                Noronha. This is a renowned eco travel destination that might just be one of the most pretty spots to
                visit in Brazil. But as it is pretty out of the way, the (domestic and foreign) crowds don't seem to
                have quite discovered it. So go here, enjoy some hiking into the rocky jungle covered interior, or enjoy
                the water and go swimming, surfing or diving. Take note that accomodation here is basic at best, but
                then that's the whole point isn't it?

                <h3>Bohey Dulang, Malaysia</h3>
                Bohey Dulang is one of the islands the forms part of the Tun Sakaran Marine Park in Sabah of Malaysia.
                You will need to travel to Semporna and spend the night there, then make your way here by boat. The main
                sight is the volcanic crater that is under water and which you get spectacular views over after you have
                made the effort of climbing your way up through the thick jungle... Once you find your way down again
                you can go swimming or snorkeling although you won't find any real beaches. But then again you won't
                find many people either!
